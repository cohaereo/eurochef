<sup>[1]</sup> Texture/entity support only indicates the ability to read headers and frame data. See the platform matrix for texture/mesh encoding/decoding support

_❔ indicates an untested feature_

_Each field is formatted as R/W. For example, if a feature can be read, but not written, the field would be ✅/❌. If a feature can be both/neither read and/or written it will be represented by a single icon instead_
